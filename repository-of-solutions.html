    <p>During the years 2019-20 I worked on my master thesis. The whole
      journey went on for almost a year and half. I started thinking on
      possible idea in December 2018. After looking out and reading like I
      have never done before, I was able to finalize the topic and submit a
      draft proposal after almost 5 months. This initial draft had to tunned
      for around another 4-5 months. In the mean time I also started learning
      the basics of Machine Learning and Neural Networks. During the summer
      of 2019 I amused myself with the power of Neural Networks by
      implementing the common starting examples such as the number
      recognition and cat-dog classifications. In November 2019 I registered
      my master thesis formally and started the actual project implementation.
      Prior to registeration I was also able to analyze the possible datasets
      that could be used and also decide up to what depths I can implement my
      idea as a master thesis.</p> <p>While working on this project, I faced
      numerous hurdles in multiple departments such as fundamentals of
      Machine Learning, installations and setting environments, Python
      programming (from simple incorrect syntax to complex multi-layered
      stuctural errors). Most of these problems (and their possible
      solutions) were logged with an intention that I don't need to
      re-"google" them. Now  in this article I wish to share them with you
      here.</p>

      <b>Permission denied error on first Git commit</b>
      <p>If you have cloned you Git repository to local and facing an error
        such as <i>"error: could not lock config file C:/Program
        Files//.gitconfig: Permission denied"</i> then may you can try opening
        the windows terminal "as Admin"</p>

      <b>Checking memory usage in Linux systems</b>
      <p>For seasonal windows users handling Linux terminal for all operations
        can become a daunting task for the initial days. Checking the memory
        usage status is an important task when running larger programs or
        processing bigger datasets. To view the memory consumptions stats, one
        can type in one of the following options, as per the details required.
        <b>top</b>, <b>free</b> or <b>vmstat</b>
      </p>

      <b>Running multiple python scripts sequentially in Linux</b>
      <p>This was one of those points that we know the solution to but still
        make it hard for ourselves. I was well aware of .bat files in windows
        to implement such functionality however, I somehow ended up thinking
        that it will be difficult in Linux. So I went on to use ... files to
        run the python scripts in sequence without manual intervention in
        between.

      <b>Starting two instances of PyCharm</b>
      <p>Another of those stupid overthinking problems that you can create for
        yourselves. I wanted to start with a new POC while I was already
        working on one. And I wished to have these 2 POCs as separate projects.
        PyCharm was the editor of my choice during the thesis time. So when I
        wanted to start the second POC I clicked on the PyCharm icon in my
        start menu however, instead of opening a new instance, it simply
        pointed to the existing instance or did nothing. Later I realised that
        this task can be achieved by going to currently opened instance of
        PyCharm and then <b>File > Open ></b> <em>select the directory of project
        to open</em><b> > Open in new window > OK</b> and that's how we get
        two instances of PyCharm editor.
      </p>

      <b>Opening Terminal in PyCharm</b>
      <p>For verifying different ways to run the python script and explore the
        functionalities of PyCharm I wanted to open the terminal from within
        the editor. I had accidently closed it earlier and now wished to open
        it back. It can be found at <b> View > Tool Windows > Terminal</b> You
        can also find other windows such as <b>Python Console</b>, <b>Data
        View</b>, etc. under the same menu.
